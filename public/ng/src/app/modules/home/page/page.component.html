        <p>Guy's a pro. We just call it a sausage. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.

        <p>There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.</p>
        <p>Really? Did nothing cancel? There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Really? Did nothing cancel? Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Whoa, this guy's straight?</p>
