## Simple Boilerplate for Laravel & Angular Material

This package only for boilerplate.
currently:
- laravel 5.4
- angular 4.2

#### why it is almost separated
i believe truly separated frontend and backend is the best
but we cant really separated it, can we? \*in common hosting environment, only 1 port

for that reason, i make it all in one.

** /api/... ** for laravel apps  
** /ng/...  ** for angular source

#### why angular in public? someone can download it right?
right, because simple, angular held only views :-)
mostly html+js+css+images. doesnt it always downloaded by browsers?  


### just created the project!
wait. i just have the idea.. need to sleep before execute all the idea ;)
